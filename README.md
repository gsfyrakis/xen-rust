# xen-rust
Rust running in Xen Mini-OS

Look at the wiki for instructions on how to use this, at the moment it is required to place this folder in the xen/stubdom folder of the xen source to build it.

Eventually I meant to change that so it can be an image that is built standalone similar to MirageOS.
